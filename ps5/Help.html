				<h3>User Documentation:</h3>
				<p>
				The name gets validated properly, however, when you try to load, save, view, or delete a 
				resume the connection becomes an issue at times. I am not sure why but the WAMP 
				server also complains frequently about unnecessary errors such as it cant find a certain 
				variable - which is available out the file (this file has been include at the top!). There 
				are plenty other casses where the variables are not recognized. 
				</p>
				
				<h3>Technical description:</h3>
				<p>
				I was planning on having auto complete switched on for the name box. But the version of 
				jquery would not allow it. Other than that, lack of time has unabled me to do anything better.
				However, I did take moderate precautions for security. I have sanitized the inputs before 
				passing to the query, made sure the names they entered valid. I used regular expression to 
				validate the names. This allowed me to eleminate any chance or sql injection.
